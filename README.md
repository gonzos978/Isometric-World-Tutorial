# Isometric-World-Tutorial
This is a backup of the source for my tutorial at GamedevTuts+ on Creating Isometric Worlds. Link - https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-isometric-worlds-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6511
The main code is in flash timeline. Cannot do much about it as I dont have a valid flash license anymore to make it external.
